## Project Overview:
This project is an employee management platform with three user roles (Admin, HR, Employee) to ensure secure operations. Admins can view verified users, adjust salaries, promote employees, and terminate accounts. HR personnel can verify employees, manage salaries via Stripe, view employee profiles with statistics, and track work histories. Employees can log work details and view payment history. Access to dashboards is role-restricted to ensure privacy and security. The platform uses HTML, Tailwind CSS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, JWT, MongoDB, TanStack Query, and Daisy UI for a robust and scalable solution.
